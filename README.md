Create a proper consise title

Generally tried to clean code to be simple and readable with proper html structure that was logical

Replaced <div> in multiple places with semantic elements like <header> <nav> <main> <section> <aside> <footer>

Changed class="content" to class="services" because its the service section

Added alt atributes to all images describing the image

Shortened and cleaned up all CSS coding in style.css to be more effient and left notes describing what areas they are

Redefined some classes and id's to make css changes take effect

Checked inspect layout on internet and it is now better to read, follow, and understand
